# House-price-Prediction
🏠 House Price Prediction
This repository contains a complete workflow for predicting house prices using machine learning. It is designed to help GitHub users and aspiring data scientists understand the essential steps involved in building a prediction model, from data exploration to model deployment.

The process begins by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, followed by performing initial data exploration to understand summary statistics and spot any anomalies. Data visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn helps to uncover relationships between features and the target variable, ensuring a deeper understanding of the data.

The notebook then addresses missing values and data cleaning, ensuring the dataset is suitable for modeling. Once prepared, the data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data. The core of this project involves building and training machine learning models (such as linear regression or ensemble methods) using scikit-learn. After training, the model makes predictions on the test set, which are then evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² score to measure accuracy.

Finally, the trained model is saved using Joblib, making it easy to deploy or reuse without retraining.
